`https://spikehd.github.io/shelter-plugins/platform-spoof/`

## Plugin Browser

Find many Shelter plugins in one place! If you're curious why something isn't showing up, <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins/blob/main/plugins/plugin-browser/README.md">view the docs on it</a>.

`https://spikehd.github.io/shelter-plugins/plugin-browser/`

## shelteRPC

arRPC replication for Shelter. Only really useful on web Discord, and if you aren't using a client/mod that has it built-in, you'll need to run an [arRPC](https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc) or [rsRPC](https://github.com/SpikeHD/rsRPC) server.

`https://spikehd.github.io/shelter-plugins/shelteRPC/`

![shelterpc](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins/assets/25207995/ebe624a1-40ea-489e-a9d7-2e49a96020b6)

## UserPFP

View and use animated profile pictures without Nitro. See the [UserPFP README](https://github.com/UserPFP/UserPFP) for more information.

`https://spikehd.github.io/shelter-plugins/userpfp/`

## You're Right

(Experimental) Float your messages to the right instead of the left. Like a texting app. Or something.
