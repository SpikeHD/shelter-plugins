## OpenAsar DOM Optimizer

Port of a neat DOM optimization trick [from OpenAsar](https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar/blob/ef4470849624032a8eb7265eabd23158aa5a2356/src/mainWindow.js#L99).
See the [OpenAsar wiki](https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar/wiki/DOM-Optimizer) for more information on how this works!

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/openasar-dom-optimizer/`

## Orbolay Bridge

Bridge plugin required to make [Orbolay](https://github.com/SpikeHD/Orbolay) work.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/orbolay/`

<img width="80%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39162923-b704-42da-af6c-ba8ec8844f23" />

## Platform Spoofer

Pretend to be on a different platform. Basically only visible to those using a platform indicator plugin.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/platform-spoof/`

## Plugin Browser

Find many Shelter plugins in one place! If you're curious why something isn't showing up, <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins/blob/main/plugins/plugin-browser/README.md">view the docs on it</a>.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/plugin-browser/`

## shelteRPC

arRPC replication for Shelter. Only really useful on web Discord, and if you aren't using a client/mod that has it built-in, you'll need to run an [arRPC](https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc) or [rsRPC](https://github.com/SpikeHD/rsRPC) server.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/shelteRPC/`

![shelterpc](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins/assets/25207995/ebe624a1-40ea-489e-a9d7-2e49a96020b6)

## UserPFP

View and use animated profile pictures without Nitro. See the [UserPFP README](https://github.com/UserPFP/UserPFP) for more information.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/userpfp/`

## Web Keybinds

(Incomplete) port of Vencord's `WebKeybinds` plugin.

`https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/web-keybinds/`

## You're Right

(Experimental) Float your messages to the right instead of the left. Like a texting app. Or something.
